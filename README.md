# Star Wars Planets



To run locally:
Run `npm install`

For development, run `npm run start-dev`

React-scripts will load up a dev server on port 3000

Note: the first time the page loads there will be a fairly long wait before the planets are displayed, but the wait will be significantly reduced for all future calls, until your local storage is cleared.
